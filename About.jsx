            <h2>About Us</h2>
            <p>We are passionate about creating delicious, affordable dessert cups made for 
                everyday moments. <br/>Our desserts are freshly prepared using quality ingredients 
                and carefully layered to deliver rich flavor in every spoonful.<br/>
                What started as a simple idea to make sweet treats more accessible 
                has grown into a small brand focused on taste, consistency, and value.<br/>
                Whether you’re taking a study break, celebrating a special occasion, or looking 
                for the perfect gift, our dessert cups are made to bring joy and satisfaction.<br/>
                We believe good desserts don’t have to be expensive. That’s why our menu is 
                designed with students and dessert lovers in mind—simple, tasty, and made with care.
